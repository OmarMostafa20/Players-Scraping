# Players-Scraping

This project provides a Python script to scrape football player data from the [transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.de/) website, which offers detailed statistics on players from the FIFA video game series. The script extracts player information and saves it into a structured format for further analysis.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Retrieves comprehensive player data, including names, ages, ratings, teams, and positions.
- **Data Storage**: Saves the extracted data into a CSV file for easy access and analysis.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `csv`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4


## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/OmarMostafa20/Players-Scraping.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:

  ```bash
  cd Players-Scraping

3. **Run the Script**:

  ```bash
  python players_scraping.py


The script will fetch player data from Sofifa and save it to a CSV file named players_data.csv in the same directory.
